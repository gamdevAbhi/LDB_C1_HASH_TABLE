## 🧩 Task 2: Character Frequency Counter

# 🎯 Features to Implement:
- Given a string, count how many times each character appears.

# 💡 Core C++ Concepts Used:
- unordered_map<char, int>
- Looping through strings
- Handling input safely (full line, not just word)
- Optional: ignore spaces, punctuation, make it case-insensitive
