# 🧩 Task 5: Group Anagrams from a List of Words

## 📝 Problem Description:
- You're given a list of words (all lowercase, no spaces or punctuation). Group the words that are anagrams of each other. Return or print each group together.

##🧠 Goal:
- Practice mapping complex keys (like sorted strings) to values using std::unordered_map.

## 📌 What I Expect:
- Use std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> (or similar logic).
- Use sorted version of each word as the key to group anagrams.
- Final output should print each group cleanly, one per line.
- Handle edge cases: empty list, single word, repeated words.
- Ensure your code is clean, readable, and idiomatic C++ — no hardcoding or shortcuts.

## When you're done, I’ll give feedback on:
- Structure
- Performance
- Idiomatic style
- Edge case handling
