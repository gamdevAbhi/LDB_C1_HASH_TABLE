# 🔧 LDB_C1_Hash_Table

A low-level implementation of a hash table as part of my **LDB (Learn-Do-Build)** personal development series.  
This repo focuses purely on the **Learn** and **Doing** phase — deep diving into how hash tables work under the hood and implementing them from scratch using C++.

---

## 🚀 Goal

- Understand the internals of hash tables.
- Explore different collision handling techniques (linear probing, chaining, etc.).
- Implement a basic hash table from scratch in C++.
- Focus on memory layout, performance, and correctness.
- Learn about perfect hashing, cuckoo hashing, robin hood hashing, SIMD hashing

> Language Focus: **C++**  
> Current Phase: **Tier 1 - Do Phase**  
> Goal: Master hash tables through progressive practice, deep dives, and system-building.

## ✅ Tier 1: STL-Based Practice (C++ `unordered_map`)

| Task                                                | Status |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Basic CRUD with `unordered_map`                     | ✅     |
| Count frequency of characters in a string           | ✅     |
| Check if two strings are anagrams                   | ✅     |
| First non-repeating character                       | ✅     |
| Group anagrams from a list of words                 | ✅     |

## 🔄 Workflow Reminder

- 🔹 **Learn Phase:** Research concepts deeply
- 🔹 **Do Phase:** Solve problems, write utilities
- 🔹 **Build Phase:** Create full-featured systems or toolsets
- 🧠 Language Focus: C++ (C# later)

## 🧠 Learning Notes

> Every commit is part of the learning log — expect code experiments, cleanup, and iterations.
> Final production-grade version (if any) will be moved to a separate repo in the `Build` phase.
